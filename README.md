## Inspiration 💡
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to our daily lives. Most of us are homestuck, while many of us tend to sit in front of computers for an extensive period of time. This change in social dynamics due to local restrictions immensely impacted human behavior and are making humans lethargic. According to reports(nimh.nih.gov), the same has resulted in an over 55% increase in the number of people affected by Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder aka ADHD which is a matter of great concern! The most affected ones are specially-abled people as well as children.

This is getting worse day by day, the report says that it actually degrades our Mental Health that has severe negative impacts on our lives including low self-esteem, loss of attention, and even in some conditions, paralysis!

We believe with creative thinking and a proper approach we can innovate novel methods that’ll help us tackle the same in an intuitive manner. Thus, we build, HealthQuest ✨

## What it does 🤔
HealthQuest is a desktop application which gamifies the process of selfcare while keeping your productivity at peak! We innovated a special learning mechanism that’ll not only help rehabilitate diagnosed youngsters, but also anyone who wants to be a part of it!

## How we built it ⚙️
**HealthQuest** is crafted with ❤️.  The Flutter App is our main frontend, authenticating users and visualizing our user’s todo. TensorFlow JS helps us to track our user’s pose to check whether they are exercising in the right way.

The flutter app consisted of 6 different pages: the main introduction page, user authentication page, selecting character page, customizing character page, bingo page and meditation page. It plays the major role in providing maximum User experience. Flutter could be designed really fast if we have the blueprint, which Figma helped a lot in designing the UI of the app. Without Figma, flutter would take too long to build UI!


## Challenges we ran into 😤
There were a lot of challenges on our way. First, because we are all online and spread around the globe, it was somewhat difficult for us to be communicating during the process. We also spent a great deal of time discussing ideas for the project. As we forwarded, we had to fix critical bugs & obviously, compiling chunks of modules into one while resolving merge conflicts, was the most hectic part!

## Design 🎨

We were heavily inspired by the revised version of **Iterative** design process, which not only includes visual design, but a full-fledged research cycle in which you must discover and define your problem before tackling your solution & then finally deploy it.

> 1. **Discover**: a deep dive into the problem we are trying to solve.
> 2. **Define**: synthesizing the information from the discovery phase into a problem definition.
> 3. **Develop**: think up solutions to the problem.
> 4. **Deliver**: pick the best solution and build that.

This time went for the minimalist **Material UI** design. We utilized design tools like Figma,  Photoshop & Illustrator to prototype our designs before doing any coding. Through this, we are able to get iterative feedback so that we spend less time re-writing code.

# Research 📚
Research is the key to empathizing with users: we found our specific user group early and that paves the way for our whole project. Here are a few of the resources that were helpful to us —

- ADHD with COVID-19, SagePub : https://bit.ly/3AYEX6X
- ADHD stats : https://bit.ly/3FwHOpt
- Impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on mental health of children and adolescents, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov : https://bit.ly/2XH5gA1
- Impact of COVID-19 on persons with disabilities in India, Hindustantimes : https://bit.ly/3DhqTrh
- TFjs API docs : https://bit.ly/3fwaioQ

## Accomplishments that we're proud of ✨
We are proud of finishing the project on time which seemed like a tough task as we started working on it quite late due to other commitments and were also able to add most of the features that we envisioned for the app during ideation. Moreover, we learned a lot about new web technologies and libraries that we could incorporate into our project to meet our unique needs. And as always, working overnight was pretty fun! :)

This project was especially an achievement for us because this time the experience was very different than what we have while building typical hackathon projects, which also includes heavy brainstorming, extensive research, and yes, hitting the final pin on the board.

## What we learned 🙌
**Proper sleep is very important! :p** Well, a lot of things, both summed up in technical & non-technical sides. Also not to mention, we enhanced our googling and Stackoverflow searching skill during the hackathon :)

## What's next for HealthQuest 🚀
*We believe that our App has great potential*. Besides, we plan to expand it's capabilities by *incorporating other languages*. This will not only permit a *greater audience* but also facilitate the exchange of diverse information and technical expertise globally. Additionally, we intend to continue improving the accuracy and speed of our Machine learning Model to provide better accuracy & low-spec support.
